zkTLS Identity Bridge

zkTLS Identity Bridge: Web2 ↔ Web3 Soulbound Alias


> This project bridges verified Web2 identities to anonymous Web3 aliases using zkTLS proofs.

---

## Inspiration

Online identity is broken.  
Users today must choose between **showing their real identity** or **being completely anonymous**.  
But what if you could be **both** — a verified, real person under a **pseudonymous alias**?

Inspired by the concept of *Ready Player One*, where *Wade Watts* becomes *Parzival*,  
this project allows users to **prove they are real** without revealing who they are.  

---

## 💡 What it does

The **zkTLS Identity Bridge** enables users to:

1. **Verify their identity** on a Web2 site (Web2-A) using zkTLS — a zero-knowledge proof of verification.  
   - The system only records “verified identity,” not real data (e.g., name or email).  
2. **Mint a soulbound alias** on Web3 tied cryptographically to that verification proof.  
   - This alias (e.g., *Parzival*) becomes the user’s persistent pseudonym in Web3.  
3. **Use the alias across other Web2 or Web3 apps (Web2-B)** for anonymous yet trusted interactions.  

> ✅ Verified identity  
> 🔒 No personal data revealed  
> 🪙 Web3-ready alias (soulbound NFT or credential)

## 🧱 How we built it

- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript (simple prototype interface)
- **Backend (Web2-A)**: Firebase Functions + Express (handles mock identity verification)
- **Smart Contract (Web3)**: Solidity (soulbound alias minting)
- **zkTLS Proof (Concept)**: Simulated via mock verification proof data
- **Storage**: Firebase / Firestore for Web2 data separation
- **Bridge**: API endpoint to connect Web2 verification → Web3 contract mint

### Simplified Flow

[ Web2-A: Identity Verification ] ↓ zkTLS Proof [ Web3: Mint Soulbound Alias NFT ] ↓ [ Web2-B: Anonymous Interaction (using alias) ]

## 🧩 How to run locally

### 1. Clone repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/suryolho/web2-to-web3-poc.git
cd web2-to-web3-poc

2. Install dependencies

npm install

3. Run backend (mock verification)

cd backend/functions
npm run serve

4. Run frontend

cd frontend
npm run dev

5. Test flow

1. Open the Web2-A page → “Verify Identity”


2. System generates zkTLS-like proof


3. Connect to Web3 wallet (mock)


4. Mint soulbound alias

🚧 Challenges we ran into

Simulating zkTLS proofs without an available public implementation.

Designing a structure where Web2 and Web3 remain separate but interoperable.

Managing gas and wallet automation without losing decentralization.

Conveying anonymity responsibly (identity = power, but needs verification).



---

🏆 Accomplishments we’re proud of

Conceptually bridged identity verification and privacy-preserving aliasing.

Designed a soulbound model that could scale to real-world systems.

Built modular architecture — Firebase (Web2) + Solidity (Web3).



---

📚 What we learned

zkTLS and account abstraction can redefine identity management.

Privacy can coexist with accountability through careful system design.

Web3 identity bridges could serve real-world KYC alternatives.



---

🚀 What’s next for zkTLS Identity Bridge

Integrate real zkTLS proof generation (e.g., using tlsn or zkPoD).

Connect to PrivyID or similar identity provider for real Web2 verification.

Deploy to Starknet for on-chain alias management.

Add bridge to Web2-B for anonymous yet trusted gameplay or interaction.
